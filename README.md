MA Grid is a web extension that displays a GitHub-style activity graph on Math Academy. It also includes some basic settings for placement (main feed or sidebar), an option to hide the existing XP tracker, and a button to clear cache.

This project is still in very early development. If you have any feature ideas or bugs, you're welcome to open an issue.
